  With today’s advancements in technology, it has become significant to stay in contact with one another. 
Ever since the introduction of mobile phones, messaging or texting has arguably become amongst the most common means of digital communication due to its ease of usage and convenience. 
In spite of its advantages, it is often more difficult to accurately decipher and interpret the emotional intent behind written messages. 
Unlike face-to-face communication, texting lacks the elements of vocal tones, facial expressions, and body language, which could increase the risk of misunderstanding and miscommunication. 
As such we set the goal of this project to analyze the emotions and sentiment of text content. 

  By using machine learning techniques, we aim to capture the patterns behind text and its emotional classification, with the objective of classifying emotions expressed in short text, enhancing our ability to detect subtle cues in digital discord. Using tools like tensorflow, sklearn, keras, we set out to build models that could capture the emotion classification in the text data. 
The models that we implemented were CNN and Bi-LSTM. Through a process of data preparation, model training/testing, and fine-tuning, the result is to use CNNs model for short text as it is efficient in capturing local patterns and Bi-LSTM model for longer content with more context as it passes data in both direction, capturing both future and past context of each component.
